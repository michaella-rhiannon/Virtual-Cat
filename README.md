### üê± Code Explanation Summary

- **`Cat` Class**  
  Defines a virtual cat with a `name`, `energy` level, and `stomach capacity`.
  - `play`: Decreases energy with each action. Prints a message when the cat is tired.
  - `eat`: Decreases stomach capacity with each feeding. Prints a message when the cat is full.

- **`main` Function**  
  - Prompts the user to name the cat, then lets the user interact by choosing to **play** or **feed**.
  - The loop continues until the user exits by entering **'n'**.

- **`__name__` Check**  
  Ensures `main` runs only if the script is executed directly, not when imported.
